# ZEDI-Segregation


The repository has code which is exclusively written for ZEDI project. 

The segregator will segregate the ZEDI files which are in the following format:

"|" is the separator used .

For 3 phase Current-voltage data:
Time|Curr(IR)|Volt(VR)|Curr(IY)|Volt(VY)|Curr(IB)|Volt(VB)

For 3 phase frequency data:
Time|Freq(R)|Freq(Y)|Freq(B)

For 3 phase Time	Temperature	Humidity	Pressure	G value	PIR1	PIR2	Co2	Therm1	Therm2	Therm3
